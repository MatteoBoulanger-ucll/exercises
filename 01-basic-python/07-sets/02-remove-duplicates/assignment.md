# Assignment

Write a function `remove_duplicates(xs)` that returns a new array equal to `xs` but with duplicated elements removed.
The elements in the result must appear in the same order as in `xs`.

Since the order of the elements in the result is of importance, you can't simply put the elements in a set: this effectively throws away all information regarding order.
